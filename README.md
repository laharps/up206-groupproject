###### Urban Planning 206A: Group Assignment

## Hello World! 

<p> Welcome to our GitHub page! We are excited you are here.
We are two dedicated, data-savvy urbanists ready to tackle some of
today's biggest questions. </p>

<p> Our research project is a spatial analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data in New York City Neighborhoods. We look at how walkable access to a vaccine distribution site, the COVID-19 case rate, race, age, and income affect vaccination rates in a neighbhorhood. This project uses real-time data to dive into disparities in vaccine distribution. </p>

<p> You can follow along on our project by looking at
our group assignments folder, where we will be
posting all of our data, analysis, and results.</p>


Stay tuned!

Lauren Harper & Nataly Rios
