We are two dedicated, data-savvy urbanist, ready to tackle some of <br>
today's biggest questions. 

For now, we will be exploring how <br>
the government policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic affected <br>
people's willingness to take the vaccine. <br>

You can follow along on our project by looking at <br>

We REALLY do hope people do take the vaccine, but in the meantime <br> 
we are hoping to shed some light on the reason's <br>
contributing to people's distrust so that we can be <br>
better prepare to tackle this pandemic!! <br>
