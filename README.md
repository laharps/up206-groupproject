###### Urban Planning 206A: Group Assignment

## Hello World! 

<p> Welcome to our GitHub page! We are excited you are here.
We are two dedicated, data-savvy urbanists ready to tackle some of
today's biggest questions. </p>

<p> For now, we will look at walkability accesss to vaccine distriubtion sites in New York City. Access to the vaccine is vital, particularly for older, low-income, and minority communities who have been hit hardest by the pandemic. We'll look at which neighborhoods have walking access to vaccine distribution sites and analyze based on neighborhood demographics. </p>

<p> You can follow along on our project by looking at
our group assignments folder, where we will be
posting all of our data, analysis, and results.</p>


Stay tuned!
