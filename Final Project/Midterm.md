# COVID-19 Vaccine Accessibility in New York City
by Nataly Rios and Lauren Harper

## What's "accessible" and why is it important?

We are defining accessibility as a 15-minute walk to a vaccine distribution center. 
Vulnerable communities were hit hardest by COVID-19 and need easy access to vaccines that doesn't require reliance on cars or public transportation.

## The Data
### NYC Vaccine Locations
New York City provides an interactive Vaccine Finder that displays all current vaccine distribution locations.
